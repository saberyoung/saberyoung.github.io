    How to define good candidates(based on my experiences)?
    </H3>
    </br>
  <H5>
  1. If the score we give is high or not: our image difference pipeline would do transients searching and scoring automatically while the score is based on the parameters we got from hotpants and sextracor. Of course, the machine learning algorithm is not good enough sometime and that's why we need visiual inspection but I have to say, it works good in most cases so we can use the score to help judging the candidates;
    <br><br>
    2. If the dirrerent image is round or not: we use hotpants to compare the PSF of the 2 images and do the image difference but sometime, the hotpants would be crazy because the PSF is not perfect Gaussian. Once the PSF matching worked bad, the resulting difference image would not be round enough and positive value in some pixels and vice versa in other pixels(we called 'positive-negative' case). Notice that these cases came from the observing and technology but not because of the transient itself.
